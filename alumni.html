                <p>
                    The Mu Chapter, Alpha Epsilon Pi's twelfth charter grant, was founded at one of America's most
                    famous institutions, the University of Virginia, on November 29, 1924. It came about through an
                    Alpha initiate, Herman Rose, who decided to pursue his education in medicine at UVA. Upon his
                    arrival there, he searched for an opportunity to establish an Alpha Epsilon Pi Chapter. Virginia,
                    noted for its beautiful campus (known as the "grounds" at Mr. Jefferson's University) and high
                    academic standing, was a fine fraternity school. Its first fraternity, Delta Kappa Epsilon, had been
                    established there in 1852. Among UVA fraternities, there were already three primarily Jewish groups
                    in operation - Zeta Beta Tau (1915), Phi Epsilon Pi (1915), and Phi Alpha (1922). Brother Rose
                    founded an active social club, whose men were of fine caliber, and he convinced them to petition
                    Alpha Epsilon Pi for a charter. Theodore Racoosin and Theodore Beskin (Beta '22), the latter a
                    native of the Tidewater area, were designated to serve as an inspection committee and reported
                    favorably on a location for initiation of new brothers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    The East Room of Madison Hall was the scene of the initiation and the banquet. Charter members were
                    S. David Cohen, Louis Friedman, Gershon Levin, Irvin Markel, and Lewis Markel, all of Norfolk; Myer
                    Hillman of Portsmouth; J. William Leshnower of Brooklyn, New York and Maurice Shaffer of Newark, New
                    Jersey. Herman Rose, of course, transferred his affiliation from Alpha to Mu. The installing
                    delegation consisted of Supreme Master Sidney Picker (Alpha '15), SLM William Cohen (Beta '22), SE
                    Herman Rolnick (Alpha '21), PSM Milton Adler (Beta '18) and PSM Theodore Racoosin (Alpha '16). To
                    show their appreciation, the brothers of Mu made a surprise presentation of a silver loving cup to
                    Brother Rose. Mu's first pledges were Joseph Nachman of Marshall, Virginia and Isaac Zacks of
                    Norfolk. The first Mu house-warming was held on February 22, 1925.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    Since none of the brothers were seniors, all returned to UVA in the fall of 1925. The early chapter
                    reports note that Brother Lou Felsenthal of Gamma spent a weekend in Norfolk during Passover and met
                    most of the Mu chapter. Plans were made for a house in Fall 1925, and the first chapter house was on
                    Preston Place. A chapter paper, the Mu Cow, was issued and became one of the best newsletters among
                    AEPi chapters.The fall pledge class included Max Berlowe of New York, Samuel Fayonsky of Greenville,
                    South Carolina, and Ben Sheren and Alexander Weiss of Norfolk. Transfer brothers were Lester H.
                    Block, from Alpha (a future Supreme Master), Charles Kavovit from Iota, and Irving Ress from Beta.
                    Irv Markel was elected to the staff of the college daily. Leading Mu Chapter in 1925-26 were: Master
                    Meyer Hillman, Lt. Master Lester H. Block, Scribe L. L. Friedman, Exchequer Lewis Markel and
                    Sentinel Gershon Levin. On November 28, 1925, the chapter initiated Max Berlowe, Daniel Fallis, Sam
                    Fayonsky, Eugene Pumpian-Mindlin, Ben Sheren, Alexander Weiss and Henry Litvack. Brother Zachs was
                    elected Scribe to take the place of Brother Friedman, who was on leave of absence due to illness.
                    Lewis Markel joined his brother Irvin on the staff of College Topics, the daily newspaper. Lester
                    Block was elected to the Jefferson Society, and Brother Fayonsky played freshman basketball. Med
                    students Herman Rose, Irving Ress, Charles Kavovit, and Henry Litvack were elected to Phi Delta
                    Epsilon medical fraternity, of which Brother Fallis was already a member. For spring of 1926 the
                    following officers were elected: Lewis Markel as Master, Lester Block as Lieutenant Master, Irvin
                    Markel as Scribe, I. P. Sacks as Exchequer and Gershon Levin as Sentinel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    For fall of 1926 the chapter chose: Lester H. Block, Master, Irvin Markel, LM; Eugene
                    Pumpian-Mindlin, Scribe; Gershon Levin, Exchequer; Max Berlowe, Sentinel. Irvin Markel made the
                    staff of the Virginia Reel, campus humor magazine. In the fall of 1926, the chapter leased a
                    fourteen-room house in the fraternity row area. The fall pledge class was seven strong, a good-sized
                    class in those days for Virginia. Brother Pumpian-Mindlin was elected advertising manager of the
                    Virginia Magazine, and assistant advertising manager of College Topics.

                    <br>
                    Mu's first formal house party was held Thanksgiving weekend of 1926. For this semester, Mu AEPi
                    ranked fifth of forty fraternities at UVA in scholarship. Dr. Ben Zion Linfield was elected a
                    faculty brother. Among the initiates were Harry Frieden, Louis Kesser, Sanford Schulhofer, Harry
                    Hilfer, Carl Kanter, Ben Kinland and Harry Ornstein. For the second term of 1926-27, the chapter
                    elected Master Irvin Markel, Lt. Master Charles Kavovit, Scribe Eugene Pumpian-Mindlin, Exchequer
                    Max Berlowe and Sentinel Sanford Schulhofer. Milton S. Goldstein, Leon Goldeng and Herman Lerner
                    were the initiates. Sam Fayonsky played varsity basketball, and won a second letter in varsity
                    baseball.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    For fall of the 1927-28 school year, the leaders selected were: Max Berlowe as Master, Eugene
                    Pumpian-Mindlin as Lieutenant Master, Sam Fayonsky as Scribe, Sanford Schulhofer as Exchequer and
                    Louis Kesser as Sentinel. The initiates in the 1927-28 year were Harold Horowitz, Ben Sheren, Milton
                    Goldberg, Alfred Wasserstrom, Richard Weiss, Norbert Altschul, Jack Hirshberg, William Rosenblatt,
                    George Kasloff, David Levin and Bertram Fishel. Business Manager of College Topics was Brother
                    Pumpian-Mindlin, Charles Kavovit was Master, Gershon Levin was Lt. Master, Harry Frieden was Scribe,
                    Sanford Schulhofer was Exchequer and Bertram Fishel was Sentinel. Ben Steinman (Beta) had
                    transferred his affiliation to Mu.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    The second Southern Regional Conclave was hosted by Mu the weekend of April 12-15, 1928. Delegates
                    were Chairman of the conclave Lester Block, Dave Haskins, Max Rosenthal, and Mac Berlowe (Omicron),
                    Louis Gillman (Epsilon), Henry Goldstein (Alpha alumnus), and Harry Erdberg (Zeta alumnus). It was a
                    great success, and Mu's famed house party was part of that success. Second term officers for 1928
                    were: Master Gershon Levin, Lt. Master Sanford Schulhofer, Scribe Carl Kanter, Exchequer Milton
                    Goldberg and Sentinel George Kasloff.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    In the fall of 1928, Mu pledged four new men, one of who, S. Harrison Kahn, was destined to become
                    Supreme Master of the fraternity. Lewis Kesser was on the varsity boxing squad. Sanford Schulhofer
                    became Master, Harry Ornstein was Lt. Master, Lewis Kesser served as Scribe, George Kasloff as
                    Exchequer and Kenneth Friede as Sentinel. Eight chapter members made the Dean's List for excellence
                    in scholarship. The Mu Cow, winner of the Publications Trophy for two years in a row, was seeking a
                    third victory under the guidance of Carl Kanter, editor, and Harrison Kahn, business manager. The
                    biggest event of that semester was the opening of the chapter's dining facility, enabling the
                    brothers to take their meals together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    In 1929-30, the chapter celebrated its fifth anniversary with the initiation of Jesse Tronic, Adolph
                    Heller, Irving Shapiro, Albert Friedman, Arthur Block and Louis Klaff. Brother Tronic was a member
                    of the Jefferson Debating Society, and Shapiro served on the editorial board of College Topics. The
                    Dean's List included Franklin Cohen, Irving Shapiro, Norbert Altschul, Harrison Kahn, Ernest
                    Horowitz, Carl Kanter and Milton Goldberg. Four more men were added in the 1930-31 year, and the
                    annual house party weekend was the usual success. For fall of 1930-31, Franklin Cohen was Master,
                    Louis Klaff, Lt. Master, Milton Goldberg, Scribe, Albert Friedman, Exchequer, Walter Miner, Sentinel
                    and Harrison Kahn, Master-at-Large. The chapter moved to a new location, a house that held fifteen
                    men. Louis Klaff became Master, with Benjamin Steinman as Lt. Master, Walter Miner as Scribe,
                    Franklin Cohen as Exchequer, Lester Mendell as Sentinel and Earl Abrams as Historian. The new house,
                    on Rugby Road, enabled the chapter to successfully rush and pledge nine men. Officers for the 1932
                    spring term were Master Louis Klaff, Lt. Master Richard Weiss, Scribe Earl Abrams, Exchequer Walter
                    Miner, Historian Milton Goldberg, Sentinel Clifford Carter and House Manager Joseph L. Frieden.
                    Brothers Albert Kurtin and Clifford Carter made the Dean's List of distinguished students.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    In 1932-33 the Depression caught up with Mu Chapter, and no new men were added. Irvin S. Markel
                    became Chapter Advisor. The chapter continued to decline, and by the end of the 1933-34 school year,
                    the last four undergraduate members had graduated, and Mu was on the verge of becoming another
                    inactive chapter. However, in the fall of 1934, George S. Toll was sent to Charlottesville to see
                    what could be done about restoring the chapter to the active roll. S. Harrison Kahn and Irvin and
                    Lewis Markel joined him. With the alumni rushing, ten men pledged, and a house was obtained at 415
                    14th Street. On January 19, 1935, at the Monticello Hotel, the following were initiated: C. Lee
                    Frieden, Irwin Frieden, Julian Frieden, Herbert Goldman, J. Milton Lukeman, Aaron Mizroch, Chester
                    H. Robbins, Jerome Rosenbloom and Raymond Tabakin. For the spring term of 1934-35, Herbert Goldman
                    was named Master, Julian Frieden became Lt. Master, J. Milton Lukeman served as Scribe, Raymond
                    Tabakin as Exchequer and Jerome Rosenbloom as Sentinel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    In the fall of 1935, the chapter obtained its former home at 133 Chancellor Street. Julian Frieden
                    was elected Master, J. Milton Lukeman served as Lt. Master, Herbert Goldman as Exchequer, Raymond
                    Tabakin as Scribe and C. Lee Frieden as Sentinel. Seven new men were pledged. Seymour Lewis was out
                    for track and Lukeman for tennis. Once again the Mu Cow was released, with Herbert Goldman as
                    Editor, Sy Lewis received his track numerals, and Burt Salpeter his tennis numerals. In the fall of
                    the 1936-37 year the chapter pledged seven more men. Aaron Mizroch was associate editor of the
                    Engineering News, and Sy Herr was in the Jefferson Society. The initiates were Robert L. Cohen,
                    Arthur Kaplan, Arthur Menoff and Everett Thorner. In the fall of 1937, ten men were pledged. The
                    1937-38 initiates were Joseph Block, Jerome Reisberg, Sidney Vernon, Sidney Marks, Bernard Siegel
                    and Martin Tuck. Marks was awarded numerals in football and basketball, and Vernon in track.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    The 1938-39 year started off on a bright note with thirteen men pledged and Herbert Chernis
                    initiated. On February 25, 1939, a fire broke out in the upper story, and as a result part of the
                    house was destroyed, so the entire house was remodeled. Elected to brotherhood were Arnold Canton,
                    William Suskin, William Gietter, Arthur Waxman and Henry Greenwald. Sid Vernon was top high jumper
                    on Virginia's track team. Brothers Canton and Waxman were on the staff of College Topics. Brothers
                    Menoff and Waxman were on the handball team. Brothers William Suskin and Richard Schneer were
                    members of the Observatory Concert Orchestra.
                </p>

                    <br>
                    On October 15, 1939, the chapter initiated Robert Ostertag, The officers for fall of 1939-40 were
                    Master Arthur Kaplan, Lt. Master Monte Binder, Scribe Joseph Block, and Exchequer Herbert Chernis.
                    Ten men were pledged, and the officers for the spring of 1939-40 were Master Arthur Kaplan, Lt.
                    Master Dick Schneer, Scribe Arnold Canton, Exchequer William Suskin and Sentinel William Gietter.

                    Although the war was now in high gear, the chapter continued active. On February 20 and 21, 1942,
                    Sidney Derman reported the hosting of the Eastern Conclave by Mu Chapter. Sixteen men were pledged
                    in 1941-42. Herbert Baumgard was captain of Debating, and elected to Delta Sigma Rho. The chapter
                    achieved a scholastic average of 87.8. Dave Stuart was Master, Laurence Deutsch was Scribe, and Josh
                    Robinson served as Exchequer. In 1942-43, World War II began to have an effect on Mu's membership.
                    Larry Solowey, who lost his life in the service, William Arrick, Seymour Zeenkov, David Stuart and
                    Don DeRoy were all called into service. Initiated were Stanley Bangel, David Robinson, Melvin
                    Leistner, Ed Pearlman, Jack Rosenbloom and Julius Jasper. George Marx boxed for the varsity, and
                    Laurence Deutsch and Josh Robinson were varsity debaters. Robert Hecht became Master, and Jack
                    Rosenbloom Scribe. The chapter gave up its house and operated out of an apartment. The chapter
                    initiated Leonid Ebin, Irwin Eskin, Charles Pressman, Leonard Rivkin, Herbert Robinson, Ross
                    Socolof, Howard Kahn, and Mortimer Schatzberg, and pledged Daniel Burack, Robert Gardner, Martin
                    Last, Leonard Quittner and William Taplitz.

                    Leon Kaplan was Master in 1943-44. Gardner was drafted in 1944, but the other four pledges and
                    Mortimer Schiff were initiated. Samuel W. Fayonsky ('30) became Mu's first Gold Star. Under the
                    leadership of Master Leonard Siegel in 1945, the chapter operated at a house on 20 University
                    Circle. It hosted the initiation of Seymour Adams, Basil Austin, Herbert Bangel, Yale Binder,
                    Richard Fink, Stanley Leon, Saul Robinson, Stanley Rosenthal, Jules Siegel, Richard Taplitz, Robert
                    Teitelbaum, Allan Unger, Murray Unger, Albert Wasserman and Yale Zimberg. In 1945-46, with Herbert
                    Bangel as Master and Bernard Teitelbaum as Scribe, the chapter moved to larger quarters at 1208 W.
                    Main. Alfred Lehman was initiated there.

                    David K. Meltzer and returning veteran Robert Gardner were initiated in the fall of 1946, and Allan
                    Segal and Clayton Fein in spring of 1947, David Robinson was now Master and Charles Pressman,
                    Scribe. Harrison Kahn, returned from service and served as Advisor. The Mu Cow chapter paper,
                    dormant during the war, was revived. The 1946-47 year showed a rapid increase in manpower, as the
                    men of Mu returned from service. The chapter numbered forty, and plans were made to obtain a
                    permanent location. In 1947-48, David Meltzer took over as Master, with Leonard Quittner as Scribe.
                    Initiates were Charles Barr, Jack Barr, David Kruger and Bentley Weinstein. In the fall of 1948,
                    with Seymour Zeenkov as Master, the chapter was able to purchase its first home, at 102 Kent
                    Terrace. It was made possible by the Tidewater Alumni Club, and loans from Theodore Racoosin and the
                    national fraternity. Thirteen men were pledged under the guidance of LM Robert Gardner, Theodore
                    Kruger was Master, with David Pressman as Scribe and Robert Hecht as Advisor.

                    Academic year 1949-50 saw Master Barry Einhorn leading the chapter to another successful year with
                    the pledging of twelve men. Brother Einhorn, Eli Chovitz and Len Quittner were active in the
                    University Players. Master Stan Needell and Lt. Master Sig Stein, led the chapter to a great year in
                    1950-51. Eli Chovitz was President of the Hillel Cabinet. Boris Goldberg was playing varsity
                    football, and Louis LaBorwit lettering in boxing, Mel Friedman was admitted to the legal fraternity
                    and Don Levy was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Boris Goldberg was elected to Student Council, reached
                    Dean's List, and joined TILKA and the IMP, Virginia honor societies. Ten new men were pledged. The
                    chapter returned to the grounds in 1951-52 with twenty-two actives and pledged eleven new men. An
                    reunion for alumni held on March 7 attracted forty alumni. Past Supreme Master Block came from
                    Buffalo to attend. Bob Levinson and Stan Needell were elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Mu men were
                    involved in almost every University activity.

                    For the next few years the chapter seemed to operate on an even keel; the most noteworthy event was
                    the initiation of Dr. Marvin Colker as a Faculty Brother. Bruce Block ('56) was initiated by his
                    father, PSM Lester Block. The social program continued its tradition of success. Dr. Robert Gardner
                    became the Chapter Advisor in 1957, and a building fund was begun, but the chapter seemed to have
                    withdrawn into a shell. There are very few chapter reports in the files and none in The Lion until
                    the spring of 1960, when Master Marshall Berman led the chapter to a successful rush season and
                    headed up the drive for a new home for Mu. In 1961, the chapter was visited by PSM Harrison Kahn and
                    Executive Secretary George S. Toll, at the request of Past Master Lyn Swartz. Fifteen pledges were
                    obtained, and Mu's Master, Robert Levine, planned for the opening of the new house by September of
                    1962. Finally 102 Kent Terrace was sold, and the chapter moved to 1514 Jefferson Park Avenue, though
                    it was still not suitable for a permanent home.

                    With the purchase of a small church located in the fraternity area, and a fine set of plans for its
                    conversion to a fraternity house, with sleeping accommodations added, Mu's dreams were realized. On
                    October 14, 1962, thirty-eight years after installation, Mu Chapter dedicated its new home on the
                    grounds, at 1707 Grady Avenue. Architect for the structure was Sol W. Cohen (Gamma '43) of Norfolk.
                    The sparkplugs for the effort were Chapter Advisor Dr. Robert Gardner and RG (later Supreme Master)
                    Nathaniel Krumbein. 250 people, including Supreme Master Maxwell Handelsman, PSM Harrison Kahn, and
                    Executive Secretary George S. Toll, attended the dedication ceremonies. Dean of the University Dr.
                    B. F. D. Runk spoke for the University, and Rabbi Raymond Krinsky of the Hillel Foundation gave the
                    dedicatory blessing. Speakers included RG Nathaniel Krumbein, Chapter Advisor Dr. Robert Gardner and
                    Master Elliot Scher. On a fun note, theatrical alumni of the 1940's enlivened the program with
                    musical selections. At last Mu Chapter was at home in a permanent location.

                    The officers for 1962-63 were Master Bill Sroka, Lt. Master Paul Laster, Member-at-Large Eddie
                    Linden, Exchequer Dan Davis and Sentinel Marc Goldberg. The chapter ranked first on campus
                    academically, Richard Schreiber was president of the Interfraternity Council, and Paul Laster,
                    sports editor of the Cavalier Daily, was elected secretary-treasurer of the IFC. Edward Linden, Rush
                    Chairman, was elected business manager of the Cavalier Daily. The pledge class numbered twenty-one.
                    The 1963-64 year saw David Greenberg in the Master's post. Other officers were Lieutenant Master
                    Herbert Rosenblum, Scribe Robert Krawcheck, Exchequer Ronald Shiftan, Steve Zimmet, Member-at-Large.
                    Alan Goldstein was secretary-treasurer of IFC, Ricky Greene was president of the UVA band, and David
                    Weinberger was to succeed Brother Linden as business manager of the Daily.

                    In 1965-66, the chapter occupied a dominant position on the grounds. Its men were in every important
                    activity; the Daily, the yearbook, the Student Union, and in Skull and Keys. For the fifth straight
                    time the chapter ranked first academically. Dave Greenberg was President of the Engineering School
                    and a member of the Judiciary Committee. Allan Goldstein was voted Outstanding University Senior,
                    and served two consecutive terms as IFC President. Bob Krawcheck was Master, Jeremy Solomon was
                    Lieutenant Master, Andy Adler was Scribe, George Shapiro was Exchequer and Dave Schreiber was
                    Sentinel. Initiates were Ed Brett, Harry Hirsch, James Broder, Mike Cohen, Steve Dickstein, Nard
                    Fleishman, Mark Huberman, Dave Lorber, Warren Sachs, Steve Schobel, Tom Shiftan, Steve Weinstein and
                    Paul Zimmet. AE&Pi; ranked fourth in intramural sports, Alan Rosenthal was managing editor of the
                    Cavalier Daily, and Mark Wine was business manager. In 1967-68 the chapter apologized in print for
                    its long absence from the columns of The Lion. Once again it led all fraternities academically.
                    Jeremy Kahn, son of PSM Harrison Kahn, was elected upstairs monitor while Ted Rubenstein handled the
                    chores downstairs.

                    For the next number of years, the chapter failed to report what was going on at Mu. The chapter
                    became more self-contained, lost contact with many of its alumni, and began to develop internal
                    problems. Without an Advisor, it began to have serious troubles, and Dr. Robert Gardner was asked to
                    fill-in although his home was quite a distance away. His son, Todd, had become a member of the
                    chapter. He held the post until 1976, the year he was succeeded by Dr. Jules (Jay) Levine (Mu '60),
                    Assistant Dean of the Medical College. With his guidance and the leadership of Ben Miller ('77) as
                    Master, the chapter began to turn around and pledged a large class. Mu was back on its way to the
                    top again. In 1978 the chapter occupied a respected position on the grounds. The house was in good
                    shape physically, the morale of the chapter was high, and the future seemed bright.

                    <br>
                    Through the years Mu Chapter has been a bright spot in the fraternity. Lester H. Block ('27) and S.
                    Harrison Kahn ('31) both served as Supreme Master, and both were awarded the Order of the Lion.
                    Irvin and Louis Markel did much to assist the chapter and maintained an interest in the national
                    fraternity. Ben Miller ('77) served most successfully as a chapter consultant, and in the fall of
                    1978 became resident counselor to Upsilon at Southern California. Its alumni are represented in all
                    walks of life and include men in every profession.
